# Deployment Fix TODO

## Completed
- [x] Added __init__.py to src/ directory to ensure proper package recognition
- [x] Updated start.sh with debug prints and PYTHONPATH=. to fix import issues
- [x] Added /healthz endpoint for Render health checks

## Next Steps
- [ ] Commit and push changes to GitHub
- [ ] Trigger manual deploy on Render
- [ ] Check deployment logs for any remaining issues
- [ ] Test the deployed API endpoints

## Changes Made
1. **src/__init__.py**: Created empty file to make src a proper Python package
2. **start.sh**: Added debug output and PYTHONPATH=. for proper module import
3. **src/app.py**: Added /healthz endpoint for health monitoring

## Deployment Notes
- JWT_SECRET is set to "supersecret" in Render environment variables
- Health check path is configured as /healthz in Render settings
- Build command: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Start command: ./start.sh
